Assignment includes two files math.h and math.c:

##math.h 

This file consists of a prebuilt header file to be used in math.c

##math.c 

This file is used to create the main function behind the calculator. The function consists of 3 inputs (num1, num2, and Operator), while returning the output (result).

 . num1 - integer value 
 . num2 - integer value
 . Operator - character value
 . result - integer value
 
There are a total of five operators that can be chosen using a switch case statement. These operators include +,-,*,/, and %.
If any other characters are entered into this field the result will automatically become zero. 
Since the result is an int variable, the only results from the calculator will be whole numbers. Therefore, division will result in the maximum amount of times num2 can fit into num1.
